# TRAFIC_LIGHT_SYSTEM_VIA_ARDUINO

Creating a traffic light system in Java for Arduino using weight sensors or other sensors would require a combination of hardware and software. Here, I can provide you with a simplified Java code snippet for controlling a traffic light system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors as an example. Please note that this is a basic illustration, and a real-world traffic system would be significantly more complex and require safety measures.
